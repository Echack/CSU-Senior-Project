# **Test Plan**

### **Test Plan Identifier**  
WET2024-TP-v1.0-2024-10-07

### **Introduction**  
- **Overview**: The goal of this test plan is to establish what needs to be accomplished on the project.  
- **Goals/Objectives**: My goals for my weather website are for it to calculate the average weather, allow more than one weather selection, and to show the history of the weather throughout the day.  
- **Constraints**: The only contraints are time related.

### **Test Items**  
Visual Studio Code version 17.9

---

### **Features to be Tested**  
- The features that are to be test is the weather history feature, the selection of more locations, and the average weather.
- This corresponds with the accuracy requirement, convenience requirement, and simplicity requirement. These are the main specifications I want to test for the project that will solely test the goal of the project.

---

### **Features Not to be Tested**  
- This test plan will not include tests that involve the display of the website or the icons used. It also will not include more features that will allow more custimazation to the website.
- My reasoning behind this is that they are not as important as making sure the overall goals of the website succeed. Once everything is tested until completion then these features will be possibly implemented.

### **Approach**  
- I will test what I mentioned by running inputs into the search bar to get the data that I will then compare to news networks to make sure that I am pulling data correctly from the source. I can also implement debugging methods that can check to see where certain values are being displayed incorrectly. 
- Specify the testing levels (if this is a Master Test Plan), testing types, and testing methods (Manual/Automated, White Box/Black Box/Gray Box). The main test plan that I am hoping to achieve is one that can test the overall performance of the code. So all my tests will be manual.

### **Item Pass/Fail Criteria**  
This will all be determined on the overall display. Here are some examples...
When I add a weather location it should...
- Pass: Correctly display the weather next to the default weather.
- Fail: Doesnt display the weather correctly next to the default weather.

When I search a location it should...
- Pass: Properly display the average weather.
- Fail: Doesnt display the average weather.

When the weather information displays it should...
- Pass: Show the history of the weather for the entire day.
- Fail: Will not display the weather for the entire day.

### **Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements**  
- If somehow the wifi I am currently using goes out then my testing activities will be suspended.  
- For me to resume testing all I would need is wifi and my computer.
