 Problem Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 **Project Description:** I will be making a weather app that will show the weather of the users location and weather of nearby locations. Users will also be able to look up other locations to find out the weather.
 **Proposed Implementation Language(s):** Javascript and HTML
 **Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. To be used in the proper implementation language(s):** Visual Studio Code
 **Additional Software/Equipment Needed:** Visual Studio Code
 **Personal Motivation:** The reason I chose to do a weather app is because every morning I look at my phone for the weather so I can decide on what to wear for the day and sometimes it feel like it is not the most accurate. So I want to create a weather app that will be accurate to the actual weather.
 **Outline of Future Research Efforts:**
 **Schedule:** 
 October 14th - November 13th: Finish project.
 November 14th - November 25th: Run tests on the project and finish Test Plan.
