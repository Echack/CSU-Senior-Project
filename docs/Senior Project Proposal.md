 Problem Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 **Project Description:** I will be making a weather app that will show the weather of the users location and weather of nearby locations. Users will also be able to look up other locations to find out the weather.
 **Proposed Implementation Language(s):** Javascript
 **Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. To be used in the proper implementation language(s):**
 **Additional Software/Equipment Needed:** 
 **Personal Motivation:** The reason I chose to do a weather app is because every morning I look at my phone for the weather so I can decide on what to wear for the day and sometimes it feel like it is not the most accurate. So I want to create a weather app that will be accurate to the actual weather.
 **Outline of Future Research Efforts:**
