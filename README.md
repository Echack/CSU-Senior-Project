# Weather Website (Wethite)

The product will be a website that more accurately displays the weather than any other site. It will combine the temperature from other sites and give the average of the weather to best display the weather. It will also have other function like allowing you to look at what the weather is like in other location.

## Compile/Deploy
To compile or deploy download to Visual Studio Code and open a live server. Also here is what the website should look like: https://wethite-5140b.web.app/

## Usage
Its usage will be based on telling the weather and allowing users to create their own account to save the locations they have chosen to observe the weather.

## Testing
Any tesing can be found in the doc folder.

## Sources Used
I did some research on how to manipulate API's, but a lot of what I used for the project was taught at the college. I did use a template on Youtube on the kind of UI I was envisioning when thinking on how to design the project. I also used Google Firebase in order to build a secure login system for my project.
